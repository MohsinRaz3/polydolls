                <p className='my-1 '>   Polydolls is a collection of unique digital collectible characters represented by non-fungible tokens (such tokens,<span className='font-semibold'>"Polydolls NFTs"</span> ) minted by a smart contract deployed to the Polygon blockchain (the <span className='font-semibold'>"Polydolls Smart Contract"</span>). The Polydolls Smart Contract associates each Polydolls NFT with a piece of digital art displaying one of the Polydolls characters (<span className='font-semibold'>"Polydolls Art"</span>). </p> <br />

                These terms (<span className='font-semibold'>"Terms"</span>) are a legally binding agreement by and between ICHIMANstudios (<span className='font-semibold'>"ICHIMANstudios,"</span> <span className='font-semibold'>"we"</span> or <span className='font-semibold'>"us"</span>), and any owner of a Polydolls NFT (<span className='font-semibold'>"you"</span> or <span className='font-semibold'>"Owner"</span>) governing the parties' rights and obligations with respect to Polydolls NFTs and Polydolls Art. <br />

Except for the Polydolls NFTs we own, ICHIMANstudios have no right or ability to seize, freeze, or otherwise modify the ownership of any Polydolls NFT. </p> <br />

                <p className='mt-2 font-normal'>    (b) <span className='underline'>We Own (but License to You) the IP in Your Polydolls Art.</span> ICHIMANstudios own all rights, title, and interest in and to the Polydolls Art including any and all copyrights, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights therein ("IP").

The License  is intended to be broad, enabling you to make both commercial and non-commercial uses of Your Polydolls Art, in any and all media, whether existing now or invented later, subject only to the restrictions set forth below. </p>

                <p className='my-2 font-normal underline'>  (b) Restrictions and Reservations.</p>

                <p className='mt-2 font-normal'>    i. The License extends only to Your Polydolls Art-meaning, the complete selection and arrangement of all base layers, features, attributes, and other elements that comprise Your Polydolls Art. Thus, while the License allows you to create and exploit Derivative Polydolls Works, the License does not grant you rights in any individual element of Your Polydolls Art, or a license to exploit any individual element separate and apart from Your Polydolls Art. For example, the License allows you to create three-dimensional renditions of, and to add new clothing to, Your Polydolls Art, but does not allow you to extract individual features (e.g., hair, accessories) for use in a separate work. </p> <br />

                <p className='mt-2 font-normal'>         ii. The License does not grant you any rights in or to ICHIMANstudios' (or any other) trade names, brands, trade dress, or trademarks (e.g., "Polydolls"), all of which are expressly reserved to ICHIMANstudios (collectively, <span className='font-semibold'>"TM Rights"</span>). You hereby agree that any TM Rights you purport to acquire, together with any associated goodwill, shall automatically, immediately, and at your expense be assigned to ICHIMANstudios. For the sake of clarity, the TM Rights do not include Your Polydolls Art, in which you may acquire trademark rights through the exercise of your rights in accordance with, and subject to, these Terms and applicable law. </p> <br />

                <p className='mt-2 font-normal'>        iii. Any application to register a trademark in Your Polydolls Art must occur during the License Term and be based solely upon the actual use of the Polydolls Art in commerce and solely for the goods or services in connection with which Your Polydolls Art has actually been used in commerce in the applicable jurisdiction as of the date of the application. Thus, you may not seek to register a trademark in Your Polydolls Art on an "intent to use" basis or where you otherwise have not used Your Polydolls Art in commerce. </p> <br />

                <p className='mt-2 font-normal'>        iv. You may not use Your Polydolls Art in a manner that expresses hate or encourages violence towards a person or group based on membership in a protected class, such as race, religion, gender, orientation, or disability. </p> <br />

                <p className='mt-2 font-normal'>        v. You may not use Your Polydolls Art in a manner that violates applicable law. </p> <br />

                <p className='mt-2 font-normal'>        vi. All rights not expressly granted herein are reserved by us. </p> <br />

                <p className='mt-2 font-normal'>     (c) <span className='underline'>License Back to ICHIMANstudios.</span> You grant to ICHIMANstudios an irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, universe-wide, royalty-free, sublicensable license to publicly display and otherwise use Your Polydolls Art alongside other Polydolls Art for the purpose of promoting or exhibiting the entire Polydolls collection. </p> <br />

                <p className='my-2 font-semibold'>     3. Enforcement. </p>

                <p className='mt-2 font-normal'>   (a)<span className='underline'> Copyright Notices.</span> You may include the following copyright notice with Your Polydolls Art: "Â© 2023 Polydolls" (the <span className='font-semibold'>"Polydolls Copyright Notice"</span>). Subject to your compliance with these Terms, you may include a copyright notice identifying you, or such other person you designate, as the copyright owner of any Derivative Polydolls Work created during the License Term, provided that you also include the Polydolls Copyright Notice. </p>

                <p className='mt-2 font-normal'>  (b) <span className='underline'>Copyright Registrations.</span> Any application to obtain a copyright registration in Your Polydolls Art shall identify "ICHIMANstudios" as the copyright owner of the Polydolls Art. Any application to obtain a copyright registration in a Derivative Polydolls Work may identify you or such other person you designate as the copyright owner but shall identify Your Polydolls Art as a preexisting work upon which the Derivative Polydolls Work is based. </p> <br />

                <p className='mt-2 font-normal'>   (c) <span className='underline'>Actions. </span>To the extent applicable law authorizes you to bring a claim for infringement based upon the unauthorized use of Your Polydolls Art, you agree that: (i) any such claim shall be based solely upon the unauthorized use of Your Polydolls Art, not other Polydolls  Art-for  example,  on the  ground that the other Polydolls  Art is substantially similar to Your Polydolls Art; and (ii) ICHIMANstudios may, in their sole discretion, join and, unless it would materially prejudice your rights, elect to take over the control of the prosecution of, any such action. </p> <br />

                <p className='mt-2 font-normal'>      (d)<span className='underline'> Disputes Among Owners.</span> ICHIMANstudios have no obligation to support the resolution of, or resolve any, dispute that may arise between Polydolls NFT owners. </p> <br />

                <p className='mt-2 font-normal'>     (a)  <span className='underline'>No Decoupling. </span> Except as expressly provided herein, ownership of a Polydolls NFT and the License are not separable in any way. You may not engage in any transaction or activity that purports to decouple the License from Your Polydolls NFT. </p> <br />

                <p className='mt-2 font-normal'>     (b)  <span className='underline'>Termination of License.</span> Upon the transfer of Your Polydolls NFT to a new Owner, as recorded by the Polydolls Smart Contract: (i) your License hereunder shall immediately and automatically terminate; (ii) you must discontinue any use of Your Polydolls Art as a trademark or other source identifier; and (iii) any trademark and corresponding registration obtained in connection with your exercise of the License shall be deemed abandoned unless duly transferred to the new Owner under a separately negotiated written agreement.  </p> <br />

                <p className='mt-2 font-normal'>    (c)  <span className='underline'>Published Polydolls Works.</span> If, during the License Term, you create and make available to the public a work using Your Polydolls Art (a<span className='font-semibold'>"Published Polydolls Work"</span> ), you may, except as set forth in Section 4(b)(ii), continue to use and exploit that Published Polydolls Work in accordance with these Terms after the License Term; provided, however, that: (i) you will be responsible for any obligations or liabilities arising from your continued use of the Published Polydolls Work after the License Term; and (ii) this privilege does not allow you to use the Polydolls Art to create any new works or materials after the License Term.

                <p className='mt-2 font-normal'>  (a) Polydolls NFTs and Polydolls Art may be used in myriad ways. While we strongly encourage transparency, communication, and research prior to acquiring a Polydolls NFT, including to understand what previous and existing uses have been made of the Polydolls NFT and Polydolls Art and how those uses may affect value, any purchase of a Polydolls NFT is at the purchaser's own risk. ICHIMANstudios is not responsible for verifying or providing information on how a Polydolls NFT or its Polydolls Art have been exploited.

Each party waives the right to a trial in court and/or by a jury. This arbitration provision shall survive any termination of the License or these Terms. </p> <br />

                <p className='mt-2 font-normal'>     (c) <span className='font-semibold underline'>Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules.</span> The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (<span className='font-semibold'>"AAA"</span>) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the<span className='font-semibold'> "AAA Rules"</span>) then in effect, except as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to AAA and give notice to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules. The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at www.adr.org. Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where one lives, with provision to be made for remote appearances to the maximum extent permitted by the AAA rules, unless the parties both agree to a different location. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, and scope of these Terms.</p> <br />

                <p className='mt-2 font-normal'>     (d) <span className='font-semibold underline'></span> Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules, and ICHIMANstudios won't seek to recover the administration and arbitrator fees for which ICHIMANstudios is responsible unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute is frivolous. If ICHIMANstudios prevails in arbitration, ICHIMANstudios will pay all of its attorneys' fees and costs and won't seek to recover them from you. If you prevail in arbitration, you will be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.</p> <br />

                <p className='mt-2 font-normal'>     (e) <span className='font-semibold underline'>Injunctive and Declaratory Relief.</span> Except as provided in <span className='font-semibold underline'>Section 10(d)</span> above, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by either party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. To the extent that you or ICHIMANstudios prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be ligated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.</p> <br />

                <p className='mt-2 font-normal'>      (f) <span className='font-semibold underline'>Class Action Waiver.</span> <span className='font-semibold'> YOU AND ICHIMANSTUDIOS AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE

If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.</p> <br />

Amendments.</span> ICHIMANstudios reserves the right to clarify or amend these Terms by publicly publishing a new version of them, including, but not limited to, on https://Polydolls.io, or any successor website. </p> <br />

                <p className='mt-2 font-normal'><span className='font-semibold'> 12.

Thus, for example, if a fork or other event purports to result in duplicate Polydolls NFTs, only the non-fungible token recorded on the blockchain designated by ICHIMANstudios will be eligible to receive the benefit of the License. Any license purportedly granted hereunder to the owner of a non-fungible token recorded on a blockchain not designated by ICHIMANstudios is void ab initio.</p> <br />

                <p className='mt-2 font-normal'>   (b) These Terms will transfer and be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties and their permitted successors and assigns.</p> <br />

                <p className='mt-2 font-normal'>    (c) These Terms constitute the entire agreement, and supersede any and all prior or contemporaneous representations, understandings and agreements, between the parties with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, all of which are hereby merged into these Terms. Without limitation, the terms of any other document, publication, course of dealing, or course of trade will not modify these Terms, except as expressly provided in Sections 11 or 13(a) or as the parties may agree in writing.</p> <br />

                <p className='mt-2 font-normal'>    (d) Failure to promptly enforce a provision of these Terms or any rights related to the Polydolls NFT or Polydolls Art will not be construed as a waiver of such provision or rights.</p> <br />

                <p className='mt-2 font-normal'>    (e) Nothing contained in these Terms will be deemed to create, or be construed as creating, a joint venture or partnership between the parties. Neither party is, by virtue of these Terms or otherwise, authorized as an agent or legal representative of the other party. Neither party is granted any right or authority to assume or to create any obligation or responsibility, express or implied, on behalf or in the name of the other party. Nothing contained in these Terms will be deemed to create any third-party beneficiary right upon any third party whatsoever.</p> <br />

                <p className='mt-2 font-normal'>   (f) The parties shall execute and deliver to the other party any and all such other instruments in reasonable mutually acceptable form and substance and shall take any and all such other actions as may be reasonably necessary to carry the intent of these Terms into full force and effect.</p> <br />

                <p className='mt-2 font-normal'>  (g) If any one or more of the provisions of these Terms should be ruled wholly or partly invalid or unenforceable, then the provisions held invalid or unenforceable will be deemed amended, and the arbitrator, court, or other government body is authorized to reform the provision(s) to the minimum extent necessary to render them valid and enforceable in conformity with the parties' intent as manifested herein.</p> <br />

                <p className='mt-2 font-normal'>   (h) The headings to sections of these Terms are for convenience or reference only and do not form a part of these Terms and will not in any way affect its interpretation.</p> <br />

                <p className='mt-2 font-normal'>  (i) Neither party will be afforded or denied preference in the construction of these Terms, whether by virtue of being the drafter or otherwise.</p> <br />

                <p className='mt-2 font-normal'>   (j) For purposes of these Terms, the words and phrases "include," "includes,""including," and "such as" are deemed to be followed by the words <span className='font-semibold'>"without limitation".</span></p> <br />

                <p className='mt-2 font-normal'>   (k) Owner may give notice to ICHIMANstudios by contacting ICHIMANstudios at ichimanstudios@gmail.com. Notice is effective upon receipt.</p> <br />

                <p className='mt-2 font-normal'>   (I) The parties have agreed to contract electronically and, accordingly, electronic signatures or any other forms of acceptance permitted by law, will be given the same effect and weight as original signatures. </p> <br />
